* Overview

#+begin_example sh
$ bb tasks
The following tasks are available:

template   create template for solution [day and year default to current]
fetch      get input for given day [requires session token stored in `.token` file ; args default to today]
boot       fetch input data and create template for given date
solve      run solution for given day [day defaults to today]
#+end_example

* Setup

To fetch input via =bb fetch= (or =bb boot=), get the AOC session cookie and put it into ~.token~.  Basic solution skeleton will be created with =bb boot=, to change it, modify ~.template.txt~.
